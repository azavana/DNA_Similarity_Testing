# DNA similarity testing

- Suppose that we have two sequences of DNA and we want to know how much they are similar. 
- This program returns the similiraty between two DNA sequences in terms of Longest Common Subsequence and the Levensthein distance between the two DNA sequences; which can be interpreted as the number of operations which requires to pass from the one to the other one.
